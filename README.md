#### ABOUT

This is a repository to store all sorts of mini projects I create in Python. I intend to follow a few tutorials and create mini python projects with my own spin to them. This is created in hopes of getting better at python and making it more than just a hobby:)

#### INSPIRATION

Much thanks to Tech With Tim and ChatGPT, since many of the project ideas come from them<3
